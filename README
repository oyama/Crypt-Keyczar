Crypt::Keyczar
==============

Keyczar is an open source cryptographic toolkit designed to make it
easier and safer for devlopers to use cryptography in their
applications. Keyczar supports authentication and encryption with
both symmetric and asymmetric keys. Some features of Keyczar include:

 * A simple API

 * Key rotation and versioning

 * Safe default algorithms, modes, and key lengths

 * Automated generation of initialization vectors and ciphertext
   signatures

 * Perl, Java, Python, and C++ implementations


INSTALLATION
------------
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

QUICK START
-----------
1. Create new 'keyset' by 'keyczar' tool:

  $ keyczar create --location=/path/to/keyset --purpose=crypt

2. Add new key to 'keyset':

  $ keyczar addkey --location=/path/to/keyset --status=primary

3. Encrypt message with 'keyset':

  $ perl > msg.txt
  use Crypt::Keyczar::Crypter;
  my $kcz = Crypt::Keyczar::Crypter->new("/path/to/keyset");
  print $kcz->encrypt('Hello World!');
  __END__

SUPPORTED CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS(current version)
---------------------------------------------------
* HMAC
   Default keys are 256 bits. SHA1 used as the hash algorithm.
   HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 and HMAC-SHA512
   algorithms are also supported.

* AES
   Default keys are 128 bits. 192 and 256 bit keys are also
   supported. CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding is used by default.

* RSA Encryption
   RSA-OAEP encryption is used. Default key size is 2048 bits.
   1024, 768, and 512 bit keys are also supported.

* RSA Signatures
   RSA-SHA1 signing is used. Default key size is 2048 bits.
   1024, 768, and 512 bit keys are also supported.

* DSA
    DSA-SHA1 signing algorithm used by default. Default key
    size is 1024 bits.
